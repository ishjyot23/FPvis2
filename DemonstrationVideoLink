Description:
We have an opening page showing our idea and options to signin and signup.
At bottom live…. count of Registered Centers and Active Volunteers is also seen.
The home page after sign in…. shows users joined and created sessions.
It also has options for joining and creating new session.
Creating session…is possible only if you register your center first (option in navbar of home page)
And we verify the center details…and your email has verified status in database.
Joining session (Volunteering to teach) is open for any signed in user.
Additionally, if user wants more than volunteering….they can access resources and donate options in navbar as well.
Thankyou!
